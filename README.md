# temp_plugin

This plugin is to show travelling images inside a carousel form. This is a simple widget. In it's first version it doesn't allow changes. However, in future I will add more travelling images into it. 



## Usage
1. Add package 'temp_plugin' to pubspec.yaml
2. Import into your dart file using 
import 'package:temp_plugin/temp_plugin.dart';


```dart
ImageViewer(),
```
